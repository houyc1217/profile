## Version Management

I use this section to track the evolution of this project and archive significant milestones.

### v2.0.0 (Current)
I simplified the repository structure to focus on the essential modules. I removed redundant configuration files, testing frameworks, and unused assets to optimize the project for easier maintenance and future extension.

### v1.0.0 (Archived)
I archived the original implementation, which included a full suite of development tools, automated testing, and CI/CD workflows. While those features were useful initially, I decided to move towards a more streamlined approach for this project.
