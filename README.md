# Yincheng Hou Personal Profile

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to be a clean and professional representation of my work as an AI Engineer and Solutions Architect. I built it using a minimalist stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Version Management

I use this section to track the evolution of this project and archive significant milestones.

### v2.0.0 (January 2024 - Current)
I performed a deep cleanup to simplify the repository structure and focus on the essential modules. I removed all development dependencies, redundant configurations (such as ESLint, Stylelint, and Jest), and cleaned up unused assets. This version reflects my current philosophy of keeping personal projects lightweight and easy to maintain.

### v1.5.0 (January 2023)
I introduced a modern redesign inspired by the Spotify Jobs aesthetic, featuring a full dark/light mode system. I also added interactive elements including a typewriter effect and a RAG-based AI assistant to help visitors learn more about my background. I unified the UI with an Apple-inspired design system for consistent spacing and corner radii.

### v1.1.0 (July 2025 - November 2025)
I focused on content updates and architectural experiments during this phase. I transitioned the navigation to a left sidebar layout and iterated on the visual presentation of my professional experience. I also updated my portfolio content to reflect my latest roles and skills as an AI Engineer.

### v1.0.0 (June 2025 - July 2025)
This was the initial foundation of the project. I set up the core structure, established the first version of my portfolio, and implemented automation tools like GitHub Actions for CI/CD and various linting frameworks to ensure code quality during the early development stages.
